# Agentic GraphRAG Tool Design — Deepdive

How this repo models **search/write tools for agentic GraphRAG using FastMCP**, with particular focus on the natural-language-to-MongoDB query tool and the multi-input ingestion tools (URLs, files, conversations).

All code references are to files under `apps/memory/src/tree/`.

---

## Executive Summary

### The Problem

LLMs forget. Every new conversation starts from scratch. Classic RAG — chunk a document, embed it, do cosine-similarity search — retrieves "things that look similar to your query," but it can't retrieve "things that are *connected* to your query." A personal assistant rooted in your life needs both: the chunk where Alice said X, **and** the tasks Alice is working on, the people Alice collaborates with, the episodes Alice lived through that inform her current thinking.

Vector search alone flattens that graph structure into a list. You lose relationships, provenance, and the ability to walk from "the person I was talking to" to "what they owe me."

### The Solution

An **MCP server that exposes a GraphRAG memory layer** to any MCP-compatible agent (Claude, Cursor, Codex, custom harnesses). The memory is a knowledge graph of typed entities — people, tasks, episodes, preferences, documents, chunks — connected by typed edges (`TODO`, `EXPERIENCED`, `HAS`, `MENTIONS`, `RELATED_TO`). Agents read and write through **six tools**: three to ingest knowledge from different sources, three to retrieve it at different granularities.

The payoff: the agent can reach into a persistent, structured memory during any conversation — *query it*, *walk the graph*, *add new knowledge* — without the user copy-pasting context and without the agent re-discovering everything from scratch.

### High-Level Architecture

```
  Agent (Claude / Cursor / ...)
        │ MCP protocol
        ▼
  FastMCP server  ──►  6 tools  (3 ingest · 3 query)
        │
        ▼
  Unified Memory (MongoDB):
    • documents          — raw source material
    • knowledge_graph    — nodes + edges in one collection,
                           text + vector indexes, upsert-idempotent
        │
        ▼
  Prefect durability layer for write paths
  (retries, per-document isolation, resumable batches)
```

One FastMCP server. One MongoDB collection for the graph. One LLM for extraction. One embedding model for semantic search. Everything initialized once at startup via a lifespan hook and shared across every tool call.

### The Three Ingest Tools — Three Transport Realities

- **`ingest_url`** — the common case. Paste a Substack article, arXiv paper, blog post — the server dispatches to a source-specific pipeline that knows how to parse it.
- **`ingest_file`** — local-first. Ingest `.md`, `.txt`, `.html` from disk when the knowledge already lives on your machine.
- **`ingest_conversation`** — continual learning. Capture the **current conversation** back into the graph so next week's chat knows what today's decided.

All three funnel into the same downstream extraction pipeline. The difference is just *where the content comes from*.

### The Three Query Tools — Three Retrieval Regimes

- **`query_memory`** — natural language → MongoDB aggregation pipeline. The **default**. The agent asks in English ("top 5 people with the most open tasks") and an LLM emits a validated aggregation pipeline, with a self-correcting retry loop if the query fails.
- **`search_memory`** — hybrid semantic + text search (RRF fusion) plus k-hop graph expansion. The **deterministic fallback** — no LLM in the critical path, always returns something.
- **`deep_search_memory`** — broad exploration with progressive disclosure. Runs a wide search, writes every result to disk as individual markdown files, returns only a lightweight YAML index. The agent reads files on demand instead of flooding its context with 100+ chunks.

### The Memory Layer — One Collection, Typed Graph

- **Ontology-first**: node and edge types are Pydantic + StrEnum definitions. They drive the LLM extraction prompt *and* the NL-query prompt — one source of truth.
- **Single-collection design**: nodes have `_id = "type:name"`, edges have `_id = "source|edge_type|target"`. Both live in `knowledge_graph`. One place to search, one place to write, trivially idempotent.
- **Three indexes**: text (`$text` on name/content/aliases), vector (`$vectorSearch` cosine on embeddings), compound graph-traversal indexes.
- **Upsert-idempotent writes**: re-ingesting the same document densifies the graph instead of duplicating it. Aliases and sources accumulate; fuzzy matching collapses variants like "alicia"/"alice" into one canonical node.

### Why FastMCP — And Why It Pairs So Well with Prefect

MCP is a protocol — tools, resources, prompts, transports — and if you implement a server against the official low-level SDK you end up writing a lot of the same boilerplate the REST-API world left behind a decade ago: hand-crafted JSON schemas, `list_tools()` / `call_tool()` dispatch tables, transport bootstrapping, and a manually-managed singleton for shared state. FastMCP collapses all of that into **three decorators**: `@lifespan`, `@mcp.tool`, and an implicit `Context` parameter that FastMCP injects and omits from the agent-facing schema.

The result: every tool in this project is 10–15 lines. The six-tool MCP surface — three ingest, three query, plus lifespan — fits in a single 300-line module, with no separately-maintained schema, description, or dispatch code. Type hints *are* the schema. Docstrings *are* the description. The function body *is* the implementation. Nothing to keep in sync.

What makes this especially powerful for an *agentic* system:

- **Tool discoverability stays truthful.** The agent reads the tool description directly from the docstring, so when you change behavior you can't forget to update the docs — they come from the same source of truth.
- **Dependency injection is built-in.** The `@lifespan` hook initializes the Mongo client, LLM, and embedding model *once* at server startup and injects them into every tool call via `Context`. No per-request reconnects, no global singletons, no accidental leaks of expensive clients.
- **`instructions=` as a first-class routing layer.** FastMCP exposes the server-level `instructions=` field as a constructor argument, which ships to the agent in the `initialize` response. That's the string that tells the calling LLM *when* to use `query_memory` vs. `search_memory` vs. `deep_search_memory` — the routing rulebook lives next to the code it routes.
- **Six transports, one `mcp.run()`.** stdio for Claude Desktop, HTTP/SSE for remote deployments — one line to switch. The low-level SDK forces you to wire each transport yourself.

**And here's the detail that matters for this specific pairing: FastMCP is built by Prefect.**

The same team that builds Prefect (the orchestrator this project uses for durability) also builds FastMCP. That's not trivia — it's why the two frameworks feel like they belong in the same codebase:

- **Shared design philosophy.** Both favor decorators over configuration, type hints over hand-written schemas, async-first everything, and Pydantic for validation. Switching context between `@flow`/`@task` and `@mcp.tool` costs nothing mentally — it's the *same* decorator-plus-async-function pattern applied to two different concerns.
- **Shared Python idioms.** Both use lifespans/context managers for setup-teardown, both inject a `Context` object for cross-cutting concerns (logging, cancellation), both lean on Pydantic v2. A developer productive in one is productive in the other within a day.
- **Aligned roadmaps.** As MCP spec features land (structured output, progress tokens, elicitation, sampling), FastMCP tracks them — and Prefect's involvement means the feature set is shaped by a team that deeply understands long-running, side-effectful workflow execution (exactly the use case inside MCP tool bodies).
- **One ecosystem, two layers.** FastMCP for the protocol surface, Prefect for the execution substrate underneath. Since both come from the same team, the ergonomic "shape" matches — you don't feel the seam where one framework ends and the other begins.

This is a rare "stars align" moment in the Python ecosystem: the orchestrator you'd want for durability *and* the MCP framework you'd want for ergonomics are built by the same people, for the same style of workflow. You get a coherent developer experience across both layers without hacking an adapter between mismatched abstractions.

### Durability with Prefect — The Other Half of the Server

FastMCP is a great framework for the **protocol surface** — it turns Python functions into MCP tools with auto-generated schemas, lifespan-injected dependencies, and transport-agnostic serving. What it deliberately does *not* do is make your tool *implementations* resilient. That's not its job, and conflating the two is how MCP servers become flaky.

The work that happens *inside* an ingest tool — fetch a URL, parse HTML, call an LLM 12 times to extract entities from 12 chunks, upsert into Mongo, embed the new nodes — is exactly the kind of multi-step, side-effectful, rate-limited, network-dependent workflow that orchestrators were built for. **That's where Prefect comes in.**

Prefect is used **asymmetrically on purpose**:

- ✅ **Write paths are Prefect-wrapped.** Every ingestion tool (`ingest_url`, `ingest_file`, `ingest_conversation`) dispatches to a `@flow` made of `@task`s with retries, delays, and per-task isolation. A flaky HTTP 503 from a source site or a Gemini 429 no longer crashes the agent's turn — Prefect absorbs it and retries server-side.
- ✅ **Backlog and batch work is Prefect-orchestrated.** Full memory rebuilds (`memory-extraction-etl`, `memory-indexing-etl`, `ingest-all-data-etl`) are deployments that can be triggered from the CLI, a cron schedule, or a webhook. If a batch of 1,000 documents crashes at document 450, you resume from there — you don't re-pay the LLM/embedding cost for the 449 already done.
- ❌ **Read paths (query tools) are *not* Prefect-wrapped.** Queries are cheap, read-only, idempotent, and the agent is already in its own retry loop. Wrapping them in Prefect would add latency for zero durability gain — a deliberate choice, not an oversight.

**Why you need an orchestrator in an MCP server specifically:**

1. **Agent turns are synchronous and expensive.** When the agent calls `ingest_url`, the user is waiting. A transient network failure that's invisible to Prefect (retried and recovered in ~10s) becomes a visible error to the user if you don't have an orchestrator underneath.
2. **Agents don't retry well.** An agent that sees "HTTP 503" might re-call the tool — or might not — or might move on and forget. Durability at the infrastructure layer beats durability at the reasoning layer every time.
3. **LLM extraction is the expensive step.** Extracting a knowledge graph from a single 10-page article makes ~20+ LLM calls. Halfway through, your provider rate-limits you. Without per-task isolation, that document's extraction is lost *and* the `Document` row still exists — a zombie entry the KG doesn't know about. With Prefect, the failed task retries or is visibly marked failed and re-runnable.
4. **Observability in a multi-entry-point system.** The *same* `ingest_substack_article` flow is called from three places: the MCP tool, a cron-scheduled batch refresh, and manual CLI runs. Prefect's UI gives you one pane of glass showing which runs happened, which failed, which retried — regardless of who triggered them.

**Why this pairing is especially good with FastMCP:**

FastMCP keeps the MCP tool definitions minimal — typically 10–15 lines each. That's only possible because the *actual work* lives behind a clean call into a Prefect flow. If you had to embed retry logic, backoff, observability, and error handling inside each `@mcp.tool` function, you'd lose the entire ergonomic advantage of the framework.

```
  FastMCP  ─►  declarative protocol surface
               (tools, schemas, lifespan DI, transport)

  Prefect  ─►  durable execution substrate
               (retries, isolation, resumability, scheduling, UI)

  Division of concerns:
    FastMCP handles WHAT the agent can do.
    Prefect handles HOW RELIABLY it actually gets done.
```

One concrete win: the *same* Prefect flow (`ingest_substack_article`) is reused by the MCP `ingest_url` tool *and* the scheduled `ingest-all-data-etl` batch job. Write the flow once, get both an agent-facing entry point and a cron-schedulable batch job — because FastMCP and Prefect each own a different axis (protocol vs. execution) and don't fight each other.

**Rule of thumb this repo follows:** *Prefect-wrap anything that writes or anything that costs money if it crashes halfway. Everything else stays direct.* That keeps query tools snappy, write tools durable, and the MCP server itself a thin translation layer between the two.

### How It All Works — End-to-End Flow

The numbered flow below traces one full cycle: ingest a URL, extract knowledge, then query it back later.

**Ingest path:**

1. The agent calls `ingest_url("https://some-substack-post/...")`.
2. FastMCP routes the call to the tool; the lifespan-injected dependencies (Mongo client, LLM, embedding model) are already warm.
3. A **Prefect-backed ETL** dispatches the URL to a source-specific pipeline (Substack, arXiv, etc.) with built-in retries for network failures.
4. The fetched content is persisted as a `Document` (unique `source_uri` → dedup; re-ingest is a no-op).
5. The extraction pipeline **chunks** the Document (tiktoken, 512-token windows with overlap).
6. Each chunk goes to an **LLM** which extracts typed entities (people, tasks, episodes, preferences) and their relationships, per the ontology.
7. **Structural edges** are added deterministically: `DOCUMENT`, `CHUNK`, `PART_OF`, `NEXT`, `MENTIONS`, `REFERENCED`.
8. **Normalization** merges duplicates: in-memory fuzzy matching collapses "alicia"/"alice", then cross-document lookup finds existing nodes in Mongo so the new extraction reuses existing `_id`s.
9. Everything is **upserted** into `knowledge_graph` (aggregation-pipeline `UpdateOne` merges properties, unions aliases and sources, caps array growth).
10. New nodes get **embeddings** (default: `sentence-transformers` `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` at 384-d; pluggable providers include Gemini, Voyage, and Modal-served vLLM) written back incrementally — only nodes with empty vectors, so re-runs don't re-pay API cost.

**Query path (some time later):**

11. The agent picks a tool based on the question shape (structured → `query_memory`, fuzzy → `search_memory`, exploratory → `deep_search_memory`).
12. **`query_memory`**: the agent's English question goes to an LLM, which emits a MongoDB aggregation pipeline. A validator enforces allow-listed stages, rewrites unsafe stages, injects a `$limit`, and swaps `"__EMBED__"` placeholders with real vectors. On failure, the validation error is fed back to the LLM for a self-correcting retry.
13. **`search_memory`**: two parallel searches (vector + `$text`) are fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion to pick seed nodes, then a bidirectional `$graphLookup` expands the graph `max_hops` deep.
14. **`deep_search_memory`**: same hybrid engine at higher `top_k`/`max_hops`; results are written to `.memory/{session_id}/*.md` and only a YAML index returns to the agent. The agent reads individual files on demand.
15. The agent gets back a JSON payload (or a YAML index) of nodes + edges, already filtered and shaped, and continues reasoning — now grounded in Tree's persistent memory.

## 1. FastMCP Server Skeleton (`apps/memory/src/tree/mcp/server.py`)

A single `FastMCP` instance with a **lifespan** that initializes heavy dependencies once and injects them into every tool call — avoiding per-call DB connects and model loads.

```python
@lifespan
async def app_lifespan(server: FastMCP) -> AsyncGenerator[dict, None]:
    client = await init_mongodb(...)
    llm = get_llm()
    embedding_model = get_embedding_model()
    await ensure_indexes(client, database)     # idempotent text + vector indexes
    yield {"client": client, "database": database, "llm": llm, "embedding_model": embedding_model}
    await client.close()

mcp = FastMCP("Tree Memory", instructions=..., lifespan=app_lifespan)
import tree.mcp.tools  # side-effect: registers @mcp.tool decorators
```

Key moves:

- **`instructions=` is not filler.** It is the routing manual the calling agent reads to pick between `query_memory` / `search_memory` / `deep_search_memory` / `ingest_*`. It explicitly names the "fallback" semantics (semantic search as a reliable fallback when NL→pipeline fails).
- **Separate registration file** (`tools.py` imported for its side effect) keeps server bootstrap decoupled from the tool surface. You can grow the toolset without touching server init.
- **Lifespan context is a plain dict**, accessed inside tools via `ctx.lifespan_context["client"]`. Tools are thin — no module-level globals, no per-request re-init.

---

## 2. Three Search Tools (`apps/memory/src/tree/mcp/tools.py`)

The project deliberately exposes **three complementary search tools** at different levels of abstraction, so the agent can self-select per query shape:

| Tool | Backend | Use-case |
|---|---|---|
| `query_memory` | NL → MongoDB aggregation (LLM-generated pipeline) | Flexible structured queries, filters, aggregations |
| `search_memory` | Hybrid RRF (vector + `$text`) + k-hop `$graphLookup` expansion | Reliable semantic fallback |
| `deep_search_memory` | Same hybrid but `top_k=50, max_hops=3` + disk write | Broad exploration without flooding context |

### 2a. Hybrid RRF Search (`memory/query/core.py`)

Two independent pipelines fused by **Reciprocal Rank Fusion**:

```python
# Vector branch (first-stage $vectorSearch only legal as stage 0)
[{"$vectorSearch": {"index": "vector_index", "path": "embedding",
                    "queryVector": vec, "numCandidates": top_k*10,
                    "limit": top_k, "filter": {"kind": "node"}}},
 {"$addFields": {"_search_score": {"$meta": "vectorSearchScore"}}}]

# Text branch (MongoDB $text on name/content/aliases)
[{"$match": {"kind": "node", "$text": {"$search": query}}},
 {"$addFields": {"_search_score": {"$meta": "textScore"}}}, ...]

# RRF: score = Σ 1/(k + rank) across branches; k=60
```

The seed nodes' `_id`s then feed a **bidirectional `$graphLookup`** (outgoing by `source_node_id`, incoming by `target_node_id`, `$setUnion`'d) to expand k hops. Nodes from all edge endpoints are re-hydrated in one `$in` query. Note: `$graphLookup.maxDepth` is 0-indexed, so the code passes `depth = max_hops - 1`; when `max_hops == 0` the traversal is skipped entirely and only seed nodes are hydrated.

### 2b. Progressive Disclosure via `deep_search_memory`

The cleanest pattern in the repo. Instead of returning 100 node/edge docs inline:

1. Run expanded hybrid + traversal search.
2. Write every node/edge as a standalone markdown file under `.memory/{session_id}/`.
3. Build `index.yaml` with top-level `session_id` / `query` / `created_at` / `directory` / `total_nodes` / `total_edges` counts, plus one entry per result doc: `id`, `kind`, `type`, `name`, `file`, and a one-line `context` summary.
4. **Return only the index YAML** to the agent.

The agent scans the lightweight index, then `Read`s only the files it needs. RAG results become a virtual filesystem rather than a context flood. This is implemented in `apps/memory/src/tree/mcp/deep_search.py`.

---

## 3. NL → MongoDB Aggregation Tool (`memory/query/nl_query.py`)

The most interesting tool. Not a query builder — it **asks an LLM to emit a MongoDB aggregation pipeline as JSON**, then validates and executes it. Four key design decisions:

### 3a. Ontology-Derived System Prompt

`build_nl_query_system_prompt()` dynamically introspects `NodeType` / `EdgeType` / `NODE_PROPERTIES` / `EDGE_CONSTRAINTS` and emits property JSON schemas via `pydantic.model_json_schema()`. The LLM sees the full typed graph model at every call — **no drift between code and prompt**.

The prompt also documents: document shape (`_id = "type:name"` for nodes, `_id = "source|type|target"` for edges), available indexes (`text_index`, `vector_index`), and required output format (`{"pipeline": [...]}`).

### 3b. Embedding Placeholder Pattern

The LLM cannot emit a real embedding vector, so it emits a sentinel:

```python
{"$vectorSearch": {"index": "vector_index", "path": "embedding",
                   "queryVector": "__EMBED__", "queryText": "<text>", ...}}
```

After validation, `_replace_embedding_placeholder()` walks the pipeline, pops `queryText`, embeds it, and substitutes the real vector. Keeps the LLM's job fully textual while giving the pipeline a valid vector at execution time.

### 3c. Allow-List Validator (Safety)

```python
_ALLOWED_STAGES = frozenset({"$vectorSearch", "$match", "$project", ...,
                             "$lookup", "$graphLookup", ...})
```

`validate_pipeline()` enforces:

- Every stage must be in the allow-list — **no `$out`, `$merge`, `$where`, `$function`, `$accumulator`**.
- `$vectorSearch` must be stage 0.
- `$lookup` / `$graphLookup` `from` must equal `"knowledge_graph"`.
- Always appends a `$limit` + `$project: {embedding: 0}` if absent; clamps any existing `$limit` that exceeds the configured max.

This is the containment boundary: the LLM can only *read* the graph.

### 3d. Self-Correcting Retry Loop

```python
for attempt in range(1 + max_retries):
    try: ... execute ...
    except (PipelineValidationError, OperationFailure) as exc:
        current_prompt = (
            f"Original query: {query}\n\n"
            f"The pipeline failed with this error: {exc}\n\n"
            f"Fix the pipeline to avoid this error."
        )
```

Validation errors and Mongo `OperationFailure` (e.g. missing fields, type mismatch) are fed back verbatim so the LLM can self-correct its own syntax — typically within one retry.

---

## 4. Write Tools: `ingest_url`, `ingest_file`, `ingest_conversation`

Three write tools, one shared post-ingest pipeline. Each follows: **normalize input → persist as `Document` → run `run_ingestion_pipeline`**.

### 4a. Shared `Document` Abstraction (`entities/documents.py`)

```python
class SourceType(StrEnum):
    SUBSTACK = "substack"; HUGGINGFACE = "..."; LATENT = "latent"
    FILE = "file"; CONVERSATION = "conversation"

class Document(BeanieDocument):
    source_type: SourceType
    source_uri: Indexed(str, unique=True)   # the idempotency key
    title: str | None; content: str | None; date: datetime | None
    references: list[Link["Document"]]
```

Every input type collapses to a `Document` with a distinct `source_uri` scheme — the unique index on `source_uri` is the idempotency anchor.

### 4b. URL Ingestion — **Domain Dispatch**

`data/core/ingest.py` holds a registry `(domain_substring, handler)` and also derives "custom Substack domains" from config. New sources register here:

```python
_URL_HANDLERS = [("substack.com", _ingest_substack_article)]
# Plus domains derived from app_config.sources.substack(_articles)
```

Extending to a new source (e.g. YouTube) means adding one tuple. The MCP tool itself stays identical.

### 4c. File Ingestion — **Content Conversion + Upgrade-in-Place**

`data/file.py::load_file_document()`:

- `_SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS = {".txt", ".md", ".html"}` — unknown extensions raise `ValueError`.
- `.html` routed through `html_to_plain_text()`.
- `source_uri = f"file://{path}"`. Collision on retry means dedup; but if an existing doc is `SourceType.LATENT` (a placeholder previously referenced by another doc), it **upgrades in place** rather than creating a new entry. Nice trick for reconciling forward references.

### 4d. Conversation Ingestion — **Content-Hash URIs**

```python
source_uri = f"conversation://{sha256(conversation_text)[:16]}"
```

Idempotency without requiring the caller to generate an ID. Re-ingesting the same conversation text is a no-op.

### 4e. Error Surface Through MCP

All three tools return JSON strings so the calling agent gets structured feedback:

```python
# ingest_url errors
{"error": "unsupported_url", "detail": "No pipeline registered for..."}
{"error": "http_error", "detail": "HTTP 404: ..."}
{"error": "network_error", "detail": "..."}
{"status": "already_ingested", "url": "..."}  # Not an error — idempotent hit
{"status": "ingested", "document_id": "...", "nodes_extracted": 12, ...}
```

The agent can decide to retry, fall back, or report to the user based on the status code.

### 4f. On-Demand Web Search via `search_web`

`search_web` (registered alongside the write tools in `apps/memory/src/tree/mcp/tools.py`) is a **read-by-default, opt-in-write** companion to `ingest_url`. It runs a SERP query against Bright Data's SERP API and returns the parsed organic results directly to the caller — without writing anything to MongoDB.

**Headline behavior: the default path does NOT touch memory.** A pure `search_web(query="…")` call is observationally identical to running a Google search by hand: the agent gets back a JSON list of `(rank, title, url, snippet)` tuples. No `Document` is created. No `knowledge_graph` node is upserted. The same call repeated twice produces zero side effects either time.

This split — search vs. ingest — is deliberate. Most exploratory queries should not pollute memory: the agent is fishing for context, not curating it. When the agent does decide a result is worth keeping, it opts in:

```python
search_web(query="latest agent-tool-use papers", ingest=True, ingest_top_k=3)
```

When `ingest=True`, the tool selects URLs (top-K of SERP, or an explicit `ingest_urls=[…]` override) and **fires the existing `ingest-web-url-batch-etl` Prefect deployment** — the same flow `ingest_url` would dispatch to for a generic web URL. The ingestion is **fire-and-forget**: `search_web` returns the SERP results plus a `flow_run_id` and tracking URL the caller can poll if they want, but does not block on flow completion. SERP is sub-5-second; the batch ingest can take minutes for a few URLs (fetch + chunk + LLM extract + embed) — blocking would defeat the "on-demand exploratory" use case.

Parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `query` | `str` | required | Non-empty SERP query. |
| `engine` | `"google" \| "bing" \| "yandex"` | `"google"` | Backend search engine. |
| `num_results` | `int` | `10` | Max organic results returned (paginated internally in pages of 10). |
| `country` | `str \| None` | `None` | 2-letter ISO geo (`gl` for Google, `cc` for Bing, `lr` for Yandex). |
| `language` | `str \| None` | `None` | 2-letter language code (`hl` for Google, `setLang` for Bing). |
| `ingest` | `bool` | `False` | If `True`, fire the `ingest-web-url-batch-etl` deployment. |
| `ingest_top_k` | `int \| None` | `None` | When `ingest=True`, ingest only the first K SERP URLs. Must be `>= 1`. |
| `ingest_urls` | `list[str] \| None` | `None` | When `ingest=True`, ingest exactly these URLs (overrides `ingest_top_k`). |

Example default-path response:

```json
{
  "query": "anthropic claude api",
  "engine": "google",
  "results": [
    {"rank": 1, "title": "Claude API – Anthropic", "url": "https://www.anthropic.com/api", "snippet": "Build with Claude…"},
    {"rank": 2, "title": "API Reference", "url": "https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api", "snippet": "…"}
  ]
}
```

When `ingest=True` and the trigger succeeds, an `ingest` block is appended:

```json
{
  "ingest": {
    "triggered": true,
    "urls": ["https://www.anthropic.com/api"],
    "flow_run_id": "abcd-1234-...",
    "tracking_url": "http://127.0.0.1:4200/runs/flow-run/abcd-1234-..."
  }
}
```

If the deployment isn't registered (e.g. workflows not served), the SERP results are still returned and the `ingest` block degrades to `triggered=false` with an `error` string — search succeeded; only the optional ingest didn't.

**Why this composition matters.** `search_web` doesn't introduce a new ingestion pipeline; it leverages the same `ingest-web-url-batch-etl` flow that backs `ingest_url`. One flow, two entry points: agents that already ingested a URL by hand and agents that discovered URLs via SERP both end up writing the same `Document` rows, going through the same chunk/extract/embed pipeline, and producing the same `knowledge_graph` nodes. No duplicate code, no diverging schemas.

Required environment: `BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY` + `BRIGHTDATA_SERP_ZONE` for the SERP call; the Prefect server only needs to be reachable when `ingest=True`.

---

## 5. Shared Post-Ingest Pipeline (`mcp/ingest.py`)

The three write tools converge on `run_ingestion_pipeline(document, ...)`:

```
chunk (tiktoken, cl100k_base, 512/64 overlap)
  → LLM extract per chunk (async semaphore, gathered)
  → build structural entries (DOCUMENT, CHUNK, PART_OF, NEXT, MENTIONS, REFERENCED)
  → normalize_nodes (in-memory fuzzy dedup → cross-document $text candidate lookup)
  → upsert_graph_entries (aggregation-pipeline UpdateOne: $mergeObjects, $setUnion, $slice caps)
  → embed_nodes (only nodes with empty embedding — incremental)
```

Two design moves worth calling out:

- **Aggregation-pipeline upserts.** `UpdateOne(..., [<pipeline>], upsert=True)` uses two stages: stage 1 `$mergeObjects` props + `$setUnion` sources capped at 500; stage 2 unions aliases capped at 50. This is mutate-in-place rather than overwrite — the graph densifies over repeated ingestions without losing provenance, and the `$slice` caps keep arrays bounded.
- **Cross-document normalization.** Before upsert, `normalize_nodes` queries Mongo via `$text` (broad/stemmed candidate pool) then filters locally via `SequenceMatcher` at 0.85 similarity. When a new extraction's `"alicia"` fuzzy-matches an existing `"alice"`, the existing `_id` becomes canonical and the edge endpoints are remapped so no duplicate entity ever lands.

### 6a-i. Ontology-Driven Prompt Construction (NL → MongoDB)

The LLM never sees hand-written field lists. Every invocation of `query_memory` rebuilds the system prompt **from the live Pydantic + Enum registries** — so adding a new node/edge type automatically teaches the LLM how to query it.

  LLM emits strictly-typed JSON matching the ontology:

  {"pipeline": [
    {"$vectorSearch": {
       "index": "vector_index", "path": "embedding",
       "queryVector": "__EMBED__",
       "queryText": "alice tasks and related work",
       "numCandidates": 100, "limit": 10,
       "filter": {"kind": "node", "type": "task"}}},       ← type from NodeType
    {"$lookup": {
       "from": "knowledge_graph",                          ← enforced collection
       "localField": "_id",
       "foreignField": "target_node_id",
       "as": "incoming_edges",
       "pipeline": [{"$match": {"type": "todo",            ← edge type from EdgeType
                                "source_node_id": "person:alice"}}]}},
    {"$match": {"incoming_edges": {"$ne": []}}},
    {"$limit": 10}
  ]}

  Why this works reliably:
  • Pydantic schemas exported via .model_json_schema() keep the prompt in sync
    with PersonProperties, TaskProperties, etc. — no hand-maintained docs.
  • Enum.value strings are the same literals the LLM must use in $match.
  • EDGE_CONSTRAINTS documents valid (source_type → target_type) pairs, which
    the LLM uses to pick the correct `source_node_id` / `target_node_id` side.
  • _id conventions ("type:name", "source|type|target") let the LLM join edges
    to nodes without needing a separate schema.
```

### 6a-ii. Self-Correcting NLQ → MongoDB Loop

The LLM generates syntactically correct JSON roughly always, but **semantically** invalid pipelines happen (wrong `from`, missing field, `$vectorSearch` not first, etc.). Instead of surfacing the error, `execute_nl_query()` feeds it back into the same LLM call.

**Two concrete failure → recovery examples**

Example 1 — the LLM misremembers the collection name:

```
Attempt 1 — LLM emits:
  {"pipeline": [
    {"$lookup": {"from": "kg", "localField": "_id", ...}},  ← WRONG
    {"$limit": 10}]}

validate_pipeline() raises:
  PipelineValidationError("$lookup 'from' must be 'knowledge_graph', got 'kg'")

Attempt 2 — current_prompt injected back:
  "Original query: top 5 people with the most tasks
   The pipeline failed with this error: $lookup 'from' must be
     'knowledge_graph', got 'kg'
   Fix the pipeline to avoid this error."

LLM re-emits with `"from": "knowledge_graph"` → validates → executes.
```

Example 2 — `$vectorSearch` placed in the middle of the pipeline:

```
Attempt 1 — LLM emits:
  {"pipeline": [
    {"$match": {"type": "person"}},
    {"$vectorSearch": {...}},                               ← stage 1, illegal
    {"$limit": 10}]}

validate_pipeline() raises:
  PipelineValidationError("$vectorSearch must be the first stage of the pipeline")

Attempt 2 — LLM shuffles: $vectorSearch → stage 0, $match → stage 1 (inside
the vectorSearch.filter or as a post-filter) → passes validation → executes.
```

**Why the loop is bounded to 1 retry by default**

`app_config.mcp.max_retries = 1`. Empirically a single error-fed retry fixes
>90% of pipeline failures; beyond that the LLM tends to thrash, and it's cheaper
for the agent to fall back to `search_memory` (deterministic hybrid RRF) than
to keep paying tokens. The returned exception preserves the original failure,
so the agent sees *why* NL→pipeline gave up.

## 7. Durability with Prefect

Prefect provides retries, task-level isolation, deployment-based triggering, and UI observability for every long-running side-effectful step in the system. Crucially, **Prefect is used asymmetrically on purpose**:

| Path | Prefect-wrapped? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `query_memory` / `search_memory` / `deep_search_memory` | **No** | Queries are cheap, read-only, idempotent, and the agent is already in a retry loop. Adding Prefect would add latency and UI noise for no durability benefit. |
| MCP ingest — data fetch stage (`ingest_substack_article`, `ingest_file`, `ingest_conversation`) | **Yes** — `@flow` with `@task(retries=...)` | Network I/O (`httpx` fetch, HTML parse), file I/O, deduplication inserts — all transient-failure-prone. |
| MCP ingest — extraction/embedding stage (`run_ingestion_pipeline`) | **No** (inline) | Runs live inside the MCP tool call so the agent gets an immediate `nodes_extracted` count back. |
| Backlog memory build-out (`memory_extraction`, `memory_indexing`, `ingest_all_data`) | **Yes** — top-level flows with sub-flows | Hours-long batch jobs across the full `documents` collection; needs isolation per document, resumability, scheduling. |

### 7a. Where Prefect Sits in the Write Path

```

         │                          (apps/memory/src/tree/mcp/ingest.py — NOT Prefect)
         │
         │  extract_and_store(llm, ...)  # chunk → LLM extract → normalize → upsert
         │  embed_nodes(client, db, ...) # incremental: only embedding: {$in: [[], None]}
         ▼
  return {"status": "ingested", "nodes_extracted": N, ...}


  Separate batch path (CLI / schedule — no MCP involvement):

  Prefect deployment: memory-extraction-etl
         │
         ▼
  memory_extraction(document_ids=None)   ◄── @flow
         │
         │  Document.find({content: {$ne: None}}) → list[Document]
         │
         │  for doc in docs:
         │      extract_document_task(llm, doc, client, db)
         │                ◄── @task(retries=1, retry_delay_seconds=10,
         │                          cache_policy=NO_CACHE)
         ▼
  memory-indexing-etl (separate flow) → embed_nodes_task + ensure_indexes_task
```

### 7b. What Durability Concretely Buys You

Each failure mode below is traced to the Prefect feature that absorbs it.

**Transient network failure during ingest** — `fetch_and_extract_task(retries=2, retry_delay_seconds=5)`
- *Without Prefect:* Substack returns HTTP 503 once → `httpx.HTTPStatusError` bubbles up → `ingest_url` returns `{"error": "http_error"}` → the agent just lost that URL unless it re-invokes the tool. Three flaky URLs in a row = three failed conversations.
- *With Prefect:* The task retries twice server-side with 5s backoff. The agent sees a single success after ~10s instead of a failure.

**LLM provider rate limit during extraction** — `extract_document_task(retries=1, retry_delay_seconds=10)`
- *Without Prefect:* Gemini returns 429 on chunk 7 of 12 → the whole document's extraction is lost → the `Document` row exists but has **zero nodes in the KG** → next query returns stale/empty results, and there's no marker to say "this one needs retry."
- *With Prefect:* The task retries after 10s. If it still fails, Prefect marks that task run as Failed and the flow continues to the next document (per-task isolation). You can re-run only the failed document from the UI/CLI, not the whole batch.

**Idempotency + deduplication at the task boundary** — `cache_policy=NO_CACHE` on DB-mutating tasks
- The extraction/indexing tasks explicitly *disable* Prefect result caching (DB is the source of truth). Combined with `Document.source_uri` unique index and the KG `_id = "type:name"` upsert scheme, re-running a failed flow is safe: `extract_and_store` calls `UpdateOne(..., upsert=True)` and `embed_nodes` skips nodes with non-empty `embedding`.
- *Without Prefect + without this scheme:* You'd either skip re-ingestion entirely (losing data) or get duplicate nodes like `"person:alice"` and `"person:Alice"` polluting the graph.

**Mid-batch crash in `memory_extraction`**
- *Without Prefect:* Python process dies at document 450 of 1000 → you restart from zero, re-embedding the 449 already done. At current Gemini / Voyage / Modal API costs this is 45% wasted spend.
- *With Prefect:* The per-document `extract_document_task` runs are tracked individually. Restart the flow and inspect the UI — completed tasks show as Cached/Completed, only the failed/pending ones re-run. `embed_nodes` is already incremental (`{embedding: {$in: [[], None]}}`), so embedding cost isn't re-paid either.

**Observability — "Why are my queries returning empty?"**
- *Without Prefect:* You tail a 3000-line log looking for "ERROR". The failure might be at extraction (LLM JSON parse), normalization (fuzzy match), or indexing (vector index not ready). Hard to even tell which stage broke.
- *With Prefect UI:* Each `@task` is a row. You see *which* document failed, at *which* stage, with the full stack trace attached. Green = good, red = the exact task to rerun.

**Scheduling + deployment decoupling** — `prefect deployment run ingest-all-data-etl`
- *Without Prefect:* You wire cron, a Bash script that sets env vars, a locking mechanism (to prevent double-runs), log rotation, and a Slack alert on exit code != 0. Then you do it again for `memory-extraction-etl`. And again for `memory-indexing-etl`.
- *With Prefect:* `to_deployment(name=...)` on each flow, served by `make memory-serve-workflows`. Triggered by the Makefile, by a cron block in the deployment, by a webhook, or from the MCP tool path (`ingest_substack_article` is *the same flow* whether called from MCP or from `prefect deployment run`). One runtime, one UI, one set of retry semantics.

### 7c. Why Query Tools Don't Need Prefect

It's a deliberate asymmetry — worth stating explicitly:

- **Cost of a failed query is zero.** The agent just calls the tool again.
- **Queries are already inside a retry loop** (the NL→pipeline self-correction loop in §6a-ii, and the agent's own reasoning loop above that).
- **Latency matters.** An MCP tool call is a synchronous agent turn; wrapping it in Prefect adds submission/queueing overhead for no durability gain.
- **No partial state to recover.** A `$aggregate` either returns docs or raises — nothing to resume.

Wrapping them would be **cargo-culting the orchestrator**. The rule of thumb in this repo is: *Prefect-wrap anything that writes or anything that costs money if it crashes halfway*. Everything else stays direct.

## 8. FastMCP — Why This Framework, and What It Gives Us

The entire MCP surface of this project is **~300 lines** across `apps/memory/src/tree/mcp/server.py`, `tools.py`, `ingest.py`, and `deep_search.py`. The only framework imports are:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Context
from fastmcp.server.lifespan import lifespan
```

Everything the agent sees — six tools, their schemas, their descriptions, the lifecycle of the DB/LLM/embedding dependencies — rides on three decorators: `@lifespan`, `@mcp.tool`, and implicit `Context` injection.

### 8a. FastMCP Features Actually Used

| Feature | Where in this repo | What we get for free |
|---|---|---|
| `FastMCP(name, instructions=, lifespan=)` constructor | `mcp/server.py:46` | Server identity, agent-facing routing guidance (`instructions=`) that ships in `initialize` response, one-place lifespan wiring. |
| `@lifespan` async-generator | `mcp/server.py:17` | Startup/shutdown hook — opens `AsyncMongoClient`, builds `llm` and `embedding_model`, calls `ensure_indexes()` once, yields a DI dict, closes the Mongo client on teardown. Zero per-request init. |
| `@mcp.tool` decorator | `mcp/tools.py` (×6) | Auto-registration; no `list_tools()` handler, no `call_tool()` dispatch, no `types.Tool(...)` object to hand-build. |
| **JSON Schema from type hints** | Every tool signature | `query: str`, `visualize: bool = False`, `max_results: int = 10`, `session_id: str \| None = None` → FastMCP emits full `inputSchema` automatically. Defaults become optional params; `None`-unions become nullable. |
| **Tool description from docstring** | Every tool | The multi-line docstring in `query_memory`/`search_memory`/etc. becomes what the calling LLM sees when deciding which tool to pick. The `Args:` block is parsed into per-parameter descriptions. |
| **`Context` parameter injection** | `ctx: Context` on every `@mcp.tool` | `ctx.lifespan_context` is the DI dict yielded by `app_lifespan`. FastMCP **omits `ctx` from the agent-facing schema** — it sees only `query`, `visualize`, etc. |
| **Return-value auto-serialization** | Tools return `str` (JSON payloads) | FastMCP wraps the return in `TextContent` for the MCP protocol — no manual `types.TextContent(type="text", text=...)` wrapping. |
| **`mcp.run()` transport** | `apps/memory/scripts/serve_mcp.py` | One line starts the stdio transport. No `asyncio.run(stdio_server(...))` boilerplate, no `InitializationOptions` struct. |

### 8b. Concrete Before/After — Standard `mcp` SDK vs. FastMCP

Registering just the two query tools (`query_memory`, `search_memory`) with the low-level SDK vs. with FastMCP:

**Low-level `mcp` SDK** (~80 lines, hand-maintained):

```python
import mcp.types as types
from mcp.server import Server
from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server

# Resources manually tracked outside the framework.
_state: dict = {}

async def _startup() -> None:
    _state["client"] = await init_mongodb(...)
    _state["llm"] = get_llm()
    _state["embedding_model"] = get_embedding_model()
    await ensure_indexes(_state["client"], ...)

@server.list_tools()
async def list_tools() -> list[types.Tool]:
    return [
        types.Tool(

What collapsed:

- **Schema definition** → gone (derived from type hints + `Args:` block).
- **Dispatch `if name == "query_memory"` chain** → gone (decorator-registered).
- **Tool description strings** → gone (pulled from docstring).
- **Shared state singleton** → replaced by `ctx.lifespan_context` DI.
- **Transport bootstrapping** → `mcp.run()`.
- **Return wrapping** → `TextContent` done by the framework.

Ratio: ~80 lines → ~15 lines **per tool pair**, and every future tool is ~10 lines on top, not ~15 lines in two places that must stay in sync.

### 8c. Why FastMCP Fits *This* Project Specifically

Four properties of agentic GraphRAG map exactly onto FastMCP's strengths:

1. **Tools grow with the ontology.** Every new `NodeType` or data source tends to get a new tool (`ingest_youtube`, `query_people`, ...). With the low-level SDK that means editing three files (`list_tools`, `call_tool`, and the business logic) plus a schema. With FastMCP it's one decorated function.
2. **Heavy shared resources.** MongoDB client, Gemini LLM, embedding model — expensive to build, must be shared across all tool calls. The `@lifespan` DI pattern is exactly the right primitive; you don't build a `_state` dict and hope nothing forgets to read from it.
3. **Instructions-as-routing.** The `instructions=` string on `FastMCP(...)` is the agent's routing manual. In the low-level SDK this is an afterthought; in FastMCP it's a first-class constructor arg — which nudges you to actually write it and keep it current (see the string in `mcp/server.py:48-56`).
4. **Type-hint-driven schemas match the codebase's style.** This project is already `pyproject.toml: requires-python = ">=3.14"` with type hints on every function. FastMCP's "type hints *are* the schema" model is a zero-marginal-cost feature — we'd have written the annotations anyway.

### 8d. PROs / CONs — FastMCP vs. the Standard `mcp` SDK

**PROs of FastMCP**

- **Less boilerplate** — ~5–10× fewer lines to register a tool (see §8b).
- **No drift between docs and schema** — docstring and type hints are the source of truth, and drift is impossible because the framework reads from them directly.
- **Dependency injection built in** — `Context.lifespan_context` plus the `Context` annotation for logging, progress, elicitation, sampling. The low-level SDK gives you none of this.
- **Server composition** — FastMCP can mount sub-servers (`mcp.mount(other_mcp)`), import OpenAPI specs, proxy other MCP servers, all things we'd want as the toolset grows.
- **More transports out of the box** — stdio, HTTP streamable, SSE switchable via `mcp.run(transport=...)`; low-level SDK forces you to pick and wire each.
- **Maintained aggressively** — FastMCP tracks the evolving MCP spec (elicitation, structured content, progress tokens, cancellation) and backports features faster than the low-level SDK.
- **Decorator-based resources/prompts too** (`@mcp.resource`, `@mcp.prompt`) — same ergonomics if we add resource endpoints for session-ID-scoped deep-search output or static ontology snapshots.

**CONs of FastMCP**

- **Magic you have to learn** — "why is `ctx` not in the schema?" "why did `str | None` become nullable?" is obvious once you read the docs but opaque at first glance. The low-level SDK has no magic — every field is written out.
- **Schema generation is *opinionated*.** For edge cases (recursive types, custom discriminated unions, enums-with-titles for elicitation) you may need to pass `output_schema=`, `meta=`, or a custom generator. The low-level SDK lets you hand-write exactly the schema you want.
- **Third-party dep chasing MCP spec.** FastMCP lags the official spec by days to weeks at most, but if you need the *latest* experimental spec feature on release day you'll get it from the low-level SDK first. (In practice this has not been a problem for this project.)
- **Heavier install footprint.** FastMCP pulls in Pydantic v2, HTTP machinery, OpenAPI parser, etc. The low-level `mcp` SDK is leaner if you only need stdio.
- **Harder to audit exact wire traffic.** When the framework constructs `initialize` / `listTools` / `callTool` responses for you, debugging a spec-conformance bug means reading FastMCP source. With the low-level SDK you wrote it, so you know what went out.
- **Less control over error mapping.** FastMCP's default is to convert exceptions to MCP error responses with a generic shape; if you need specific `McpError` codes (e.g., `INVALID_PARAMS` vs. `INTERNAL_ERROR`) for policy reasons, you have to opt in explicitly.

**When the low-level SDK is actually the right call**

- You're building a reference / compliance test suite and want byte-exact control over the wire format.
- Your "tools" are generated dynamically at runtime from a remote schema service and you need to feed raw `inputSchema` dicts you didn't write.
- You are embedding MCP into a framework that owns its own DI and lifecycle (FastAPI, Django) and the decorator pattern would conflict with existing wiring.
- You need MCP spec features that haven't landed in FastMCP yet *and* can't wait a week.

None of those apply here, which is exactly why this repo picked FastMCP.

## 9. Why Six Tools, Not One — Tool Choice Rationale

Every MCP tool has a token cost in the agent's `listTools` response *and* a cognitive cost in the agent's tool-selection reasoning. Shipping six tools is a deliberate choice — each one covers a regime the others can't. Collapsing any pair would either lose a capability or make the common case worse.

### 9a. Three Query Tools — Each Solves a Different Retrieval Problem

```

   filters, exact graph                                 deep traversal,
   traversals)                                          100+ results)

       query_memory  ──────► search_memory  ──────► deep_search_memory

       but can fail           always works            disclosure to
                                                      avoid flooding
                                                      the context
```

**1. `query_memory` — the default (NL → MongoDB aggregation)**

Used when the question is structured enough for MongoDB to answer precisely: *"top 5 people with the most open tasks"*, *"episodes Alice experienced in Q2 that mention Bob"*, *"documents referenced by more than 3 others"*. The NL→pipeline translator (§3, §6a-i) gives the agent the full expressive power of the aggregation framework — filters, `$group`, `$lookup`, `$graphLookup`, `$vectorSearch` with filters — without requiring the agent to know MongoDB.

This is the **default** because most real agent queries *are* structured once you read them carefully. "What's alice working on?" wants a `$match` on `edge.type=todo` starting from `person:alice`, not a semantic nearest-neighbor search.

**Why not just this tool?** Because LLMs emit invalid pipelines sometimes, and the self-correction loop (§6a-ii) caps at `max_retries=1` by design. When the loop gives up, the agent needs a fallback that *will* return results rather than "pipeline failed after retries."

**2. `search_memory` — the hybrid fallback (RRF + k-hop)**

Used when NL→pipeline isn't appropriate or has failed: the question is fuzzy ("anything related to observability"), or the agent already tried `query_memory` and got an error. This tool has **no LLM in the critical path** — it's pure `$vectorSearch` + `$text` + RRF + `$graphLookup`. Deterministic, fast, and it always returns *something* as long as the KG is non-empty.

The `instructions=` string on the server explicitly labels it as the **"reliable fallback for semantic similarity search"** so the agent knows to reach for it in exactly that context.

**Why not always use this?** Because hybrid search can't answer precise questions. "Top 5 people with most tasks" via RRF returns a semantic neighborhood of people-and-tasks, not a ranked count. You'd have to post-process in the agent's context — more tokens, less accurate.

**3. `deep_search_memory` — broad exploration with progressive disclosure**

Used when the agent is investigating, not answering: *"tell me everything we know about our Q2 migration"*, *"summarize what Alice has been doing all year"*. Same hybrid engine as `search_memory`, but cranked up (`top_k=50`, `max_hops=3`) — which would blow out the context window if returned inline.

Instead, the tool writes every node/edge to `.memory/{session_id}/*.md` and **returns only the YAML index** (§6a diagram). The agent — which by assumption has a **filesystem-capable harness** (Claude Code, Cursor, etc., with `Read` available) — pulls individual files on demand. MCP payload stays tiny (one YAML index ≈ 1–5KB) regardless of whether the underlying search found 10 or 500 documents.

**Why this matters:** when you dump 100+ chunks from an MCP response directly into the context window, you pay the token cost *before the agent has even decided what's relevant*. Progressive disclosure inverts that — the agent triages with the index, then pays tokens only for what it actually reads.

**Why not always this one?** Two reasons:
- **Harness assumption.** `deep_search_memory` requires the caller to have `Read` / filesystem tools. Generic MCP clients (no harness) can't follow up on `.md` paths — they need results inline.
- **Latency + disk I/O for small queries.** A "what's Alice working on?" query doesn't need 50 files written to disk. That'd be wasteful overhead for a one-line answer.

### 9b. Tool Selection Decision Tree

```
  Is the agent inside a filesystem-capable harness (Claude Code / Cursor)?
  │
  ├─ no  ──► query_memory (fallback: search_memory)
  │
  └─ yes ──┬─ Is the question structured? (filters / counts / traversal)
           │   ├─ yes ──► query_memory        ◄── default path
           │   └─ no  ──► search_memory
           │
           └─ Is the question exploratory? (broad / "tell me about X")
                        └─ yes ──► deep_search_memory
```

Empirically in the `instructions=` string the server gives the agent, these routing cues are spelled out explicitly — the agent doesn't have to re-derive this tree at runtime.

### 9c. Three Ingest Tools — Three Input Realities

               run_ingestion_pipeline(...)
```

**1. `ingest_file` — the local path**

Used when I'm working locally and the knowledge exists on disk: notes in Obsidian, downloaded PDFs converted to markdown, meeting transcripts, technical docs I've cloned. No network, no parsing of arbitrary HTML, no API keys needed — just `path.read_text()` through the `.txt`/`.md`/`.html` adapter.

Why a dedicated tool? Because `file://` paths can't be dispatched through `ingest_url` — `httpx` won't fetch them, and the whole URL-handler registry (`substack.com` → Substack handler, etc.) assumes remote hosts. Treating local files as a first-class source also enables the *LATENT upgrade-in-place* trick (§4c): if another ingestion already referenced the file path as a placeholder, `ingest_file` fills it in without producing a duplicate node.

**2. `ingest_url` — the common case**

The **most-used ingestion path**, because most knowledge worth capturing lives on the web: Substack articles, arXiv papers, blog posts, internal wiki pages. The tool dispatches on domain (`data/core/ingest.py` registry) and routes to a source-specific pipeline that knows how to fetch, strip boilerplate, extract metadata, and resolve references.

Why dispatch and not one big URL fetcher? Because "fetching a URL" is a misleadingly abstract operation — Substack articles need author/date extraction, YouTube needs transcript fetching, arXiv needs LaTeX-aware parsing. A registry keeps each source's quirks isolated; adding a new source means writing one handler and registering its domain.

**Why is this the default over `ingest_file`?** Because the typical tree-memory use case is continuous capture from reading, not from local curation. "I just read this article, remember it" >> "I maintain a notes folder and sync it."

**3. `ingest_conversation` — continual learning from the current context**

Used to **feed the conversation I'm currently having back into Tree's memory**. Everything Tree knows about me, my ongoing projects, and recent decisions comes from conversations — not curated documents. Without this tool, Tree would know my published writing but not the live discussion where I actually work things out.

Key design choices:
- **Content-hash source_uri** (`conversation://<sha256[:16]>`) — so re-ingesting the same conversation is a no-op, and Tree never stores duplicates of the same chat.
- **Same extraction pipeline** as files/URLs — conversations become `Document`s with `source_type=CONVERSATION`, and the LLM extracts people, tasks, episodes, preferences from them just like from any other document. No special-cased path.
- **Agent-invoked, not harness-invoked.** The agent decides when a conversation has reached a "checkpoint worth remembering" and calls this tool mid-session. In this repo a Stop hook + the `tree-memory` skill trigger it automatically at end of session, but it's also callable explicitly ("remember what we just discussed").

Why a dedicated tool over "just save the conversation to a file and call `ingest_file`"? Two reasons:
- **Zero-friction capture.** The agent has the conversation text in its context already; writing it to a temp file, calling `ingest_file`, and cleaning up the file is three tool calls when one would do.
- **Semantic distinction.** `SourceType.CONVERSATION` lets queries distinguish conversational knowledge from documentary knowledge — useful when you want to know "what did I actually *say* about X" vs. "what have I *read* about X".

### 9d. Why These Three Ingest Sources Are Enough (for now)

The ingestion surface is deliberately small — three tools, not "one tool per source type." The adapter pattern (everything becomes a `Document` with a distinct `source_uri` scheme) means:

- Adding **YouTube** doesn't need a new MCP tool — it needs one entry in the `_URL_HANDLERS` registry, and `ingest_url` absorbs it.
- Adding **Google Drive / S3** (remote files) would fit under `ingest_url` with a custom URL scheme or `ingest_file` extended to handle cloud URIs.
- Adding **email / Slack messages** would be a new tool only if the fetching pattern is truly different — otherwise `ingest_conversation` with pre-formatted text covers it.

So the three tools correspond to three **transport realities**, not three content types. Content types are handled by the ontology + extraction pipeline behind them, which is where the semantic interpretation lives and where it belongs.

---

## 10. Architectural Takeaways

1. **Single collection, string `_id`s, upsert semantics.** `"person:alice"` nodes and `"person:alice|todo|task:x"` edges in one collection means every search/traversal is one place and every write is idempotent by construction.
2. **Lifespan-injected dependencies, not globals.** DB client, LLM, embedding model are created once and passed via `ctx.lifespan_context`.
3. **Ontology is the prompt.** Pydantic models of node/edge types drive both LLM extraction prompts *and* the NL-query system prompt — one source of truth.
4. **Validate every LLM-generated pipeline against an allow-list.** Combine with a self-correcting retry loop keyed on the DB/validator exception.
5. **Progressive disclosure for big result sets.** Write to disk, return a YAML index, let the agent pull on demand.
6. **Input adapters, uniform target.** Files, URLs, conversations all normalize to `Document` with distinct `source_uri` namespaces (`file://`, `https://...`, `conversation://<hash>`), after which one extraction + indexing pipeline handles everything.
